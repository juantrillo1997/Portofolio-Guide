| Project Link | Project Description | Libraries |
|---|---|---|
| üè¶ [Bank Client Term Deposit Prediction](https://github.com/juantrillo1997/Bank-Marketing-Prediction-Analysis-Modeling-and-Class-Imbalance-Handling) | Developed a neural network model to predict bank clients' likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit based on client attributes and campaign factors. Implemented data preprocessing techniques such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and addressing class imbalance through downsampling. Evaluated the model's effectiveness using precision, recall, and F1-score. | pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow |
| üõí [Online Retail Dataset Analysis Report](https://github.com/juantrillo1997/Online-Retail-Dataset-Analysis-Report) | Conducted exploratory data analysis on transactional data from an online retail store to identify sales trends, customer behavior, and popular products. Employed a combination of classical statistical methods (such as IQR) and machine learning techniques (like Isolation Forest) to detect outliers and anomalies, providing actionable insights to optimize store operations and enhance customer satisfaction. | pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn |
